	<h2> Low and Slow </h2>
	<p> This week I am <b> extremely </b> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn> sous vide</dfn>. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite> >Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching</q>.
	</p>
	<p> 
		Next month, we will be serving <em> Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</em>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.
