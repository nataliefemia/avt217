	<p>This website has a primary menu along the side which is very easy to read. It shows you all the options you can choose from, which makes it very easy for the viewer to know what they can do with as little amount of thought. They also have separate colors for their call to action links. The image resolution seems to be very high as well. On this site they are not making very smart choices about fonts, it has a lot going on. It also shows no logo. Having a search bar would be helpful to them. The background images are so odd and with the images it shows no consistency between the website pages because each image is different. It does not seem to have any device adaptability.  </p>

	<h3> <a href="http://www.roverp6cars.com">Rover 6 Cars</a> </h3>
	<p> The main page is very overwhelming with the use of fonts, colors, layout and images. However, when you navigate the menu and open up the other pages it becomes a little easier to read. There is a clear call to action button to go to their shop in bright contrasting colors. They have a menu bar to the left and also at the bottom have icons to find them on social media or contact them. The font size is easy to read. There also seems to be relevant pictures on the site, however they are low quality. The main logo page does not match the other pages. As well as there being no cohesion between the pages. There are also so many fonts and harsh colors on the page that it makes it very hard on the eye. The menu on the left with the words over the cars, it makes it very hard to read and understand what is going on with that menu. </p>
	<h2> The good </h2>

	<h3> <a href="https://www.southwest.com"> Southwest</a> </h3>
	<p> On the southwest website there is a clear logo that goes through all the pages so there is a good logo cohesion. The pages are also very cohesive together in general with the layout, color and contents. There is a search bar, which makes it helpful as well as easy to ready main menu and footer menus. There are relevant and high-resolution photos.  The website uses under 3 font families as well as having the smallest font still be legible. There are clear call to actions for booking, exploring, etc which is why someone would visit this website anyways. It contains device adaptability but it could be a little bit more responsive. If there was one thing that this website was not doing is different color for links, there is an underline that comes up when you hover over it.  </p>

	<h3> <a href="https://www.soul-cycle.com"> Soul Cycle </a> </h3>
	<p> The soul cycle website shows great consistency between pages with color, font and layout. It is easy to read and understand as well with little effort needed. There is half their logo at the top, which is the name and the other half, the image, at the bottom. It might be more effective to have both but I think it works for them since their name is so well known and it says cycle in the logo so you know what it is. There is a main menu that you can click options, from there you scroll down. This is a little different than the typical drop down menu but I think that they do this so you read all the information instead of just reading parts of it. There is also a footer menu with lots more helpful information.  There are clear reasons for the use of their high quality images. The use of the same 2-3 fonts is very helpful to make this visually pleasing. It is very adaptable and responsive for your devises and changing the browser size. </p>
