	<h1> Design Brief + Site Content</h1>
	
	<h2>Brief </h2>
	<h3>I found that I am not a fan of scroll websites. While I think you can have other information below the first page, I do not think you should have to scroll to see everything on the site. I also will not have a hamburger menu; I want all the options to have out. To get home I want to be able to click my name if the top left side of the page. I like white backgrounds, black type with pops of color. Instead of having a logo in the top left like my Project 1, I will just do my name in a nice typeface. 

From the home page, I want to have a sentence that describes my style of work. Have a spot that says, ‘currently:’. After that I want you to be able to see ‘what I’ve been up to:’ and be able scroll down. This will link to the projects page. My project page will be a gallery with images, different size boxes and captions.
